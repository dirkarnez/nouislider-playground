### Using
- [leongersen/noUiSlider: noUiSlider is a lightweight, ARIA-accessible JavaScript range slider with multi-touch and keyboard support. It is fully GPU animated: no reflows, so it is fast; even on older devices. It also fits wonderfully in responsive designs and has no dependencies.](https://github.com/leongersen/noUiSlider)

### TODOs
-  logarithmic slider example
  - for math usage
  - for fader in audio
